In this notebook, we demonstrate how to build and collaborating agentic AI system using CrewAI. The system integrates multiple agents, each with a specific role, to:

Gather current information from the internet about given topic.
Make a conversational script out of the information.
Workflow Overview
Define tools to support the agents, such as web search capabilities.
Create two agents for data gathering and script creation.
Define tasks corresponding to these agents.
Set up a crew that executes the tasks sequentially.
Run the crew to achieve the desired outcome.
